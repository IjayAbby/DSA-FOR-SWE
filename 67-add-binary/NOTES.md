### How the code works.
This function takes two binary strings a and b as input and returns their sum as a binary string. It uses the standard algorithm for adding binary numbers, which is similar to the algorithm for adding decimal numbers. The function iterates over the characters in the input strings from right to left using two pointers i and j. At each iteration, it calculates the sum of the current digits and a carry value (let sum = carry;). If one of the input strings is longer than the other, it adds the remaining digits of the longer string to the sum. Then, it calculates the new digit to be added to the result (result = (sum % 2) + result;) and updates the carry value (carry = Math.floor(sum / 2);). The iteration continues until all digits have been processed and there is no carry value left.

### Time and Space complexity
The solution has a time complexity of O(max(n, m)), where n and m are the lengths of the input binary strings a and b, respectively. This is because the function iterates over the characters in the input strings from right to left using two pointers i and j. The number of iterations is equal to the length of the longer input string.

In terms of space complexity, the solution has a space complexity of O(max(n, m)) because it uses a string to store the result of the addition. The length of this string is equal to the length of the longer input string plus one (to account for a possible carry value at the end).

In conclusion, this solution has a linear time and space complexity.
