The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half and then testing the middle element. If the middle element is bad, then the algorithm knows that the first bad version must be in the left half of the search space. Otherwise, the algorithm knows that the first bad version must be in the right half of the search space. The algorithm continues dividing the search space in half until it has found the first bad version.

The binary search algorithm is a very efficient algorithm for finding the first bad version. The worst-case time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n), where n is the number of versions. This means that the number of calls to the isBadVersion() API will be logarithmic in the number of versions.
