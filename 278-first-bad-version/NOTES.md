### How the code works.
The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half and then testing the middle element. If the middle element is bad, then the algorithm knows that the first bad version must be in the left half of the search space. Otherwise, the algorithm knows that the first bad version must be in the right half of the search space. The algorithm continues dividing the search space in half until it has found the first bad version.

The binary search algorithm is a very efficient algorithm for finding the first bad version. The worst-case time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n), where n is the number of versions. This means that the number of calls to the isBadVersion() API will be logarithmic in the number of versions.

### Time and Space Compexity.

* Time Complexity: The time complexity of the First Bad Version problem is O(log n). This is because the binary search algorithm is used to find the first bad version, and the worst-case time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n). The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half and then testing the middle element. If the middle element is bad, then the algorithm knows that the first bad version must be in the left half of the search space. Otherwise, the algorithm knows that the first bad version must be in the right half of the search space. The algorithm continues dividing the search space in half until it has found the first bad version.
* Space Complexity: The space complexity of the First Bad Version problem is O(1). This is because the algorithm does not require any additional memory to store any data. The only data that is stored is the current version number, which is a constant amount of data.
