### How the code works
This function takes in two strings ransomNote and magazine as arguments. It first creates an object magazineLetters to keep track of the number of occurrences of each letter in the magazine string. Then it iterates over the ransomNote string and checks if each letter is present in the magazineLetters object. If it is, it decrements the count of that letter in the object. If it is not present or its count is zero, it returns false. If all letters in ransomNote are present in magazine, it returns true.

### Time and Space Complexity.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the magazine string. This is because the function iterates over the magazine string once to create the magazineLetters object and then iterates over the ransomNote string once to check if each letter is present in the magazineLetters object.

The space complexity of this solution is also O(n) where n is the length of the magazine string. This is because the function creates an object magazineLetters to keep track of the number of occurrences of each letter in the magazine string. The size of this object is proportional to the number of unique letters in the magazine string, which can be at most n.
