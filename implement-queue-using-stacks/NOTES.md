### How the code works
The code creates a class called MyQueue, which implements a FIFO queue using only two stacks. The class has four methods: push, pop, peek, and empty.
The push method adds an element to the back of the queue. It does this by pushing the element onto the inbox stack.
The pop method removes the element from the front of the queue. It does this by popping the element off the outbox stack. If the outbox stack is empty, then the code pushes all of the elements from the inbox stack onto the outbox stack, and then pops the element off the outbox stack.
The peek method returns the element at the front of the queue. It does this by looking at the top element of the outbox stack. If the outbox stack is empty, then the code pushes all of the elements from the inbox stack onto the outbox stack, and then looks at the top element of the outbox stack.
The empty method returns true if the queue is empty, and false otherwise. It does this by checking if both the inbox stack and the outbox stack are empty.

### Time and Space Complexity.

* The time complexity of the MyQueue class is O(n) for all operations, where n is the number of elements in the queue. This is because the worst-case scenario for all operations is when the queue is full, in which case the code has to push or pop all of the elements from the inbox stack to the outbox stack.

* The space complexity of the MyQueue class is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue. This is because the class uses two stacks to store the elements in the queue, and each stack can store up to n elements.

##### Here is a more detailed explanation of the time and space complexity of the MyQueue class:

* Time Complexity: The time complexity of the push operation is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue. This is because the worst-case scenario for the push operation is when the queue is full, in which case the code has to push all of the elements from the inbox stack to the outbox stack. The inbox stack can store up to n elements, so the worst-case time complexity of the push operation is O(n).

* The time complexity of the pop operation is also O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue. This is because the worst-case scenario for the pop operation is when the outbox stack is empty, in which case the code has to push all of the elements from the inbox stack to the outbox stack, and then pop the element off the outbox stack. The inbox stack can store up to n elements, so the worst-case time complexity of the pop operation is O(n).

* The time complexity of the peek operation is O(1), where n is the number of elements in the queue. This is because the peek operation only needs to look at the top element of the outbox stack, which can be done in constant time.

* The time complexity of the empty operation is O(1), where n is the number of elements in the queue. This is because the empty operation only needs to check if both the inbox stack and the outbox stack are empty, which can be done in constant time.
